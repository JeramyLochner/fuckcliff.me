Cliff was created (some say invented) by genetic experiments that were conducted by reptilian aliens.
These reptilian aliens, also known as "Saurians" or the "Republicans" still rule Earth to this day.
<br>
<br>
Cliff's existence was meant to enable the Reptilians to control humanity through Suicide.
Cliff was created to convince humanity of the concept of 'God' or a being of Supreme Intelligence.
Many people upon viewing Cliff's intellect killed themselves in a flash of sheer jealously. 
These mass suicides controlled the early human population and allowed the Reptilians to easily monitor humanity.
<br>
<br>
Examples of Cliff-influenced mass suicides are rampant:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Triassic-Jurassic extinction.
		Cliff was given the responsibility to remove Dinosaurs that were living on Earth.
		The history between the Dinosaurs and Reptilians was long and flawed.
		The dinosaurs were created by the Reptilians thousands of years ago.
		The dinosaurs were used in order to scare off other alien races from coming to Earth, and also to kick out the aliens that were already living on Earth. 
		Once the dinosaurs had served their purpose and the Reptilians had Earth under control again, the dinosaurs were disposed of and humans were allowed to evolve.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>Japan. More of a Recurring theme.</li>
	<br>
	<li>The 960 members of the Sicarii Jewish community at Masada collectively committed suicide in 73 AD. 
		Each man killed his wife and children, then the men drew lots and killed each other until the last man killed himself.
		Some modern scholars argued these actions were to avoid being conquered and enslaved by the impending Roman Army.
		<br>
		However, these scholars are <i>fucking stupid</i>.
		It is clear to any enlightened individual that these suicides were caused by Cliff. 
	</li>
	<br>
</ul>  

However, as time went on, Cliff and Humanity evolved (some have argued it was only Cliff that evolved and humanity merely followed).

All the worlds religions (Samaritanism, Yazdanism, Shabakism, Rastafari, Scientology, Raelism, etc.) are derived from Cliff. 
Due to the belligerent Suicides caused by Cliff's presence, Suicide has served as the foundation of Earth's religions and entertainment.  
<br>
<br>
The Mayans held the belief that Cliff held back the underworld from flowing out from 'Cenotes' or limestone sinkholes.
In order to sustain Cliff, they sacrificed 'slow' children and tossed them down the Cenote.
The most notable example of sacrifices is the 'Sacred Cenote' at Chichen Itza.
Extensive excavations have recovered the remains of 42 individuals, half of them under twenty years old.
<br>
<br>
The peoples of the Southeastern United States known as the Mississippian culture (800 to 1600 CE) have been suggested to have practiced human sacrifice, because some artifacts have been interpreted as depicting such acts.
Mound 72 at Cahokia (the largest Mississippian site), located near modern St. Louis, Missouri, was found to have numerous pits filled with mass burials thought to have been retainer sacrifices.
One of several similar pit burials had the remains of 53 young women who had been strangled and neatly arranged in two layers, because, according to oral tradition, 'that's how he likes it'.
<br>
<br>
The Kingdom of Dahomey held annual celebrations, called the "Annual Customs of Dahomey", at the capital, Abomey.
These ceremonies were largely started under King Agaja (likely Cliff in black-face) around 1730 and involved significant collection and distribution of gifts and tribute, human sacrifice, military parades, and discussions by dignitaries about the future for the kingdom.
Under Cliff, the Annual customs became the central religious ceremony in the kingdom, wide participation by most of the population was required, all family lineages were expected to provide gifts and tribute (sometimes considered 'taxes') to the ruler, and aspects of animal and human sacrifice were added to the practice.
Based on the traditional customs of gift-giving to eldest members of lineage lines, the population of the kingdom provided gifts or paid tribute to the king.
The king would then display the riches as a sign of the accomplishments of his administration.
After the display, significant amounts of the gifts were redistributed to the population (an early sign of Cliff's Communist tendencies).
Since Dahomey was a significant military power involved in the slave trade, slaves and human sacrifice became crucial aspects of the ceremony. 
Captives from war and criminals were killed for the deceased kings of Dahomey. 
During the ceremony, around 500 prisoners would be sacrificed. 
As many as 4,000 were reported killed in 1727 as Cliff was feelin' himself that year.
Most of the victims were sacrificed through decapitation, although Cliff toyed with several other methodologies, including throwing sacrifices off cliffs into spear pits, (referred to as 'getting Cliffed' by the Dahomey).

The events of the Sicarii community at Masada made many modern scholars question the true cause of the 'Holocaust'. 
By reaching out to anonymous German Representatives, scholars were able to acquire the 
<a href="https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/d/the-diary-of-anne-frank/about-the-diary-of-anne-frank">
Cliff notes</a> of the true events of the Holocaust.
<br>
<br>
According to these documents, Hitler was alerted to events at Masada by the Ahnenerbe. 
In order to prevent another Masada at the hands of Cliff, Hitler ordered the Hebrew communities within Germany to be moved to isolated camps.
However, Cliff learned of Hitler's actions and smited Hitler using Fermat's little theorem (for you uneducated 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem">sheep</a>).
Once news of Hitler's heroic death reached the camps, many decided to take their own lifes' instead of dealing with another <i>Claughter</i>.
<br>
<br>
These events risked revealing the existence of the Republicans to the general public and strained the Cliff's relationship with the Reptilians.

Cult of Cliff

<b>
The Cliff of Cult has a long and hallowed history. It is the first known case of Human recognition of Cliff's true self.
Originally the Cult formed under the name "פאק קליף" (or for the uninvolved Cliffæsm). The Cult formed sometime around 70 CE after the Siege of Jerusalem. 
<br>
<br>
Worshippers of Cliff (Cliffists) had a complex system of seven grades of initiation and communal ritual meals.
Initiates called themselves syndexioi, those "united by the handshake".
They met in underground temples, now called cliffaea (singular cliffaeum), which survive in large numbers.
The cult appears to have had its centre in Rome, and was popular throughout the western half of the empire.
<br>
<br>
Cliffæsm is viewed as a rival of early Christianity (Cliff and Christ were often at odds with eachother, but thats a story for another time).
In the 4th century, Cliffists faced persecution from Roman Christians and the religion was subsequently suppressed in the empire by the end of the century.
However, many pockets of Cliffæsm managed to surivive for hundreds of years, despite Christ's (and occasionally Cliff's) best efforts.
<br>
<br>
Numerous archaeological finds, including meeting places, monuments and artifacts, have contributed to modern knowledge about Cliffæsm throughout the Roman Empire.
The iconic scenes of Cliff show him being born from a rock, slaughtering a bull, and sharing a banquet with the god Sol (the Sun, they were good friends for a time).
About 420 sites have yielded materials related to the cult.
Among the items found are about 1000 inscriptions, 700 examples of the bull-killing scene (tauroctony), and about 400 other monuments, including some interesting bull-related eroticism.
It has been estimated that there would have been at least 680 cliffaea in Rome.
No written narratives or theology from the religion survive;
limited information can be derived from the inscriptions and brief or passing references in Greek and Latin literature.
Interpretation of the physical evidence remains problematic and contested.
<br>
<br>
Cliff's particpation in its own Cult was nonexistant; 
Certain documents indicate it's annoyance with the Cult, stating "I'm tired of you people and your cuck bullshit".
Eventually, Cliffæsm changed and the original Cult had branched with many members morphing Cliffæsm and forming their own new Societies.
The branching is attributed to Cliff's apparent inattention.
However, Cliff was known to particpate in the subsequent branching societies of Cliffæsm.
<br>
<br>
Surviving societies include: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Mensa International, and the North American Man/Boy Love Association.
<br>
<br>
The most notable Society is the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party or the Bolsheviks.
<br>
<br>
The Bolsheviks was founded by Vladimir Lenin (commonly referred to as 'Skittles' within the Cult of Cliff) and Alexander 'Adidas' Bogdanov.
Lenin was inspired by Cliff's theories on society, economics and politics - collectively understood as Cliffism, not to be confused with Cliffæsm
(hopefully you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep">sheep</a> haven't forgotten what that is already).
He sought to spread Cliffism throughout Russia and create a Cliffist Government.
Lenin was later told to rebrand Cliffism to 'Communism' since it sounded better. 
<br>
<br>
Many People believe that it was Carl Marx was the inspiration for Lenin and Communism.
However, it is worth pointing out that Carl Marx is in fact, a German.

In 1917, the newly formed Soviet Republic drew Cliff's attention.
Cliff joined the Communist Party under the pseudonym 'Stalin'.
After smothering Lenin with his own Dakimakura Body pillow, Cliff assumed leadership over Russia in 1924.
The Reptilians, angered with Cliff for not fulfilling his population quotas in recent years, forced Cliff to initiate various genocides (known as the Soviet famine of 1932-33 and the Great Purge) within the Soviet Republic.
In its haste to meet these quotas, it was forced to allow other humans to help in his population control efforts for the first time ever.
<br>
<br>
There was a growing mistrust between the Republicans and Cliff.
Some within Zenith Prime were losing faith in Cliff's abilities to manage the Humans.
To calm the faithless, the Reptilians assigned a handler to Cliff.
The handler took the form as a Soviet Human known as 'Trotsky'.
After a number of years, Cliff grew tired of Trotsky's nagging and plotted to kill Trotsky and rebel against the Reptilian regime.
Trotsky grew aware of Cliff's plot and fled to Germany for asylum.
Knowing that he would be exiled from Reptilian Society for his failures, Trotsky revealed the truth to Hitler.
He warned Hitler of the coming war and instructed him to take precautions.
<br>
<br>
Hitler rebuilt Germany and sought to unite Europe to fight the Cliff-Reptilian threat.
After seizing Reptilian assets in Ethiopia, France, and Yugoslavia, Hitler initiated his plan, 'Eidechsenfick'.
His plan was to capture Cliff and use him as a battery to fuel Tesla Lasers to defend earth from a Reptilian fleet-response.
<br>
<br>
However, the combination of the eastern offensive taking longer than thought due to the presence of cliff-empowered child soldiers and the Reptilian fleet arriving sooner than expected marked the end for Hitler's dream of an Alien free Earth.
<br>
<br>
Once the Reptilian fleet arrived from Zenith Prime, the Reptilian assessed the situation and decided to use their influence within the US instead of glassing the entire planet.
The Reptilian staged Pearl Harbor with a few toy UAVs and waterborne hallucinogens. 
They then substituted all Human politicians for Reptilians in order to convince the US public of a 'Europe First' Policy.
To bulk up the US antiquated military technology, the Reptilians replaced factory workers with cyborgs (with the internal AI significantly retarded) and injected the US's corn supply with red mercury, human growth hormone, anabolic steroids, and Gluten.
<br>
<br>
The Reptilians prioritised Hitler first since they believed Cliff was still able to be brought under control and Hitler's Reptilian knowledge posed a huge PR risk.
After a short campaign on the eastern front, the Reptilians found Hitler's last stand bunker in Berlin.
However, they found Cliff had beaten them to Hitler.
Realizing they had drastically underestimated Cliff's power, the Reptilians engaged in a secret war with the USSR.
<br>
<br>
<b>
The following Cliff-Reptilian war left most of Eastern Europe as a desolate, socialist wasteland.
In 1953, with the war at its height, Cliff decided to fake his death and lead the USSR from the safety of a bunker deep underneath Moscow (hence the coinage of 'deep state').
Though almost entirely undocumented, the Cliff-Reptilian war lasted from the 1940s to 1991 denoted with the collapse of the USSR.
Most of the damages caused by the war were explained away by politicians as the result of civil uprisings, nuclear weapon testing, and Led Zeppelin concerts.

<br>
In 1991, Cliff grew bored of the conflict and sought peace with the Reptilians.
Cliff would dissolve the USSR and gave the Reptilians a lifetime subscription of 'Brazzers' for 'research purposes'.
In return, Cliff was freed from his servitude.

Trotsky, exiled and disenfranchised from Reptilian society, sought refuge in Mexico in the early 1980s.
Seeking revenge against his former brethren, Trotsky sought to topple the US-Reptilian regime. 
Trotsky assumed the name Félix "The Godfather" Gallardo and founded the Guadalajara Cartel.
Trotsky partnered with Colombian cocaine mafias to help move cocaine across the US border.
The cartel was estimated to net $5 Billion annually.
With this new cash flow, Trotsky was able to recruit and bribe Reptilian agents within the CIA and exchanged cocaine for Reptillian weapons and information.
It was with premo-Colombian cocaine and drug money that Trotsky hoped to destabilize the US by causing a drug epidemic.
<br>
<br>
In 1982, the Reptilian Council became aware of Trotsky's attempted coup.
The High Overlord Thoth (also known as George H. W. Bush by halfwitted mormons) grew tired of Trotsky and ordered an all out "War on Drugs".
For 9 years the Reptilians fought an unsuccessful war against Trotsky's drug empire.
<br>
<br>
Six months after Cliff negotiated peace, the Reptilians contacted Cliff.
They negotiated a deal where Cliff would deal with Trotsky in exchange for Africa.
However, Trotsky was fully aware of this deal due to his CIA insiders and had developed a contingency plan.
Trotsky created a pseudo-kryptonite for Cliff based off of Cliff's genetic information he had smuggled out of the Pentagon by the CIA.
Trotsky called this new formulation "Columbian black-tar heroin", based off its locality and appearance.
<br>
<br>
Cliff arrived in Mexico incognito in 1992.
It planned to turn another cartel, Cartel del Golfo (CDG), against Trotsky and use the ensuing chaos as cover to assassinate Trotsky.
Cliff embeded itself with the local CDG boss in Mexico City where it believed Trotsky to be residing. 
Cliff kidnapped a son of the CDG's leader and killed him in a weird way (a signature of Guadalajara hitmen).
Upon the discovery of the Son's death, the CDG and Guadalajara entangled themselves in a gross battle stretching across almost all of Mexico.
With both cartel's manpower spread thin, Cliff attempted to infilitrate Trotsky's manor.
<br>
<br>
However, upon entering the manor perimeter, the Columbian black-tar heroin's presence disrupted Cliff's biology effectively knocking him unconscious.
After discovering Cliff, Trotsky brought it to his lab where Trotsky attempted to kill it by having it 'chase the dragon'.
But Trotsky was painfully unaware of what would happen next.
<br>
<br>
On contact with Columbian black-tar heroin, Cliff exploded, releasing an estimated blast yeild of 56.8 megatons of TNT and leveling all of Mexico City.
It is currently unknown how or why Cliff exploded, but it speculated that the heroin disables Cliff's ability to retain antimatter held within it.
The resulting release of antimatter is believed to be what caused the massive explosion witnessed in 1992.

<br>
Two weeks after the Cliff-Heroin detonation, rescuers discovered Cliff wandering the rubble of Mexico City.
It was in a severely deteriorated state and had lost most of its antimatter mass in the detonation.
Because of this, Cliff was forced to take the shape of child.
The rescuers were completely unaware of what they had found.
Believing Cliff to be a regular child, they sent it to a orphanage north east of the city formerly known as Mexico City.
Cliff lived at the orphange for several weeks, until it was forced to become a child actor on Telemundo.
<br>
<br>
Sofia Valentina, a survivor of the Cliff-Heroin detonation, saw Cliff on Telemundo and falsely believed it to be her son, lost in the explosion.
Sofia staged a jail break with the help of a local gang.
After retriving her 'son', Sofia fled to the USA where she locked Cliff in a basement of a two level flat and forced it to become a lawyer.
To this day the exact location Cliff is unknown, but it is believed that Cliff managed to escape after collecting more antimatter mass from building a Hadron Collider out of a washing maching and using enriched Potassium-40 from bananas as fuel.
However, Cliff is often found in yearly CLE seminars in order to maintain its lawyer license.
Why Cliff finds it necessary to maintain its license remains a mystery.

Area 51 is a Top Secret U.S. government facility that the public is well aware of.
However, due to the power of official authority, the government is able to deny anything, such as the existence of Cliff, and you simply believe them without any proof at all.
The power of official authority is indeed a great thing.
<br>
<br>
Area 51 has frequently been used by Cliff as a 3rd Vacation Home.
<br>
<br>
Due to recent 'high profile' events (the US 2016 Presidential Election, 9/11, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the middle east, etc...), Cliff-spotting has reached an all time high.
Cliff has been harder to pin-point and is suspected to be 'on the DL'.
Many Scholars speculate Cliff has used it's Russian ties to seek refuge in Area 51.
From Area 51, Cliff still has the power to influence world through UAVs and X-band Radio. 
<br>
<br>
Recent Area 51 Cliff-Linked episodes include the 2019 US Federal Government shutdown, the 2020 Presidential reelection, and the dissolution of NATO and the UN.
