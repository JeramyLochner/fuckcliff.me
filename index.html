First and foremost, this website is <i>not</i> a hoax or a joke. Now, moving on...

The information on this website is, in fact, not "crap," "nonsense," or "conspiracy theories".
Attempting to hold onto your existing worldview would not be a wise decision.
So, either accept the truth now or continue to suffocate in ignorance and mental slavery.
<br>
<br>
In order to grasp the truth, you must use your free will and freedom of thought. Do not let your mind get trapped within the religious or scientific paradigms.
Religion and science are simply forms of control that were created by the ruling elite long before you were born.
And thus, it is a shame that after being born on this planet, you were raised on either of those two lies.

Cliff was created (some say invented) by genetic experiments that were conducted by reptilian aliens.
These reptilian aliens, also known as "Saurians" or the "Republicans" still rule Earth to this day.
<br>
<br>
Cliff's existence was meant to enable the Reptilians to control humanity through Suicide.
Cliff was created to convince humanity of the concept of 'God' or a being of Supreme Intelligence.
Many people upon viewing Cliff's intellect killed themselves in a flash of sheer jealously. 
These mass suicides controlled the early human population and allowed the Reptilians to easily monitor humanity.
<br>
<br>
Examples of Cliff-influenced mass suicides are rampant:
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Triassic-Jurassic extinction.
      Cliff was given the responsibility to remove Dinosaurs that were living on Earth.
	  The history between the Dinosaurs and Reptilians was long and flawed.
	  The dinosaurs were created by the Reptilians thousands of years ago, before one of the Reptilians' latest re-starts of civilization.
	  The dinosaurs were used in order to scare off other alien races from coming to Earth, and also to kick out the aliens that were already living on Earth. 
	  Once the dinosaurs had served their purpose and the Reptilians had Earth under control again, the dinosaurs were disposed of. </li>
  <br>
  <li>Japan. More of a Recurring theme.</li>
  <br>
  <li>The 960 members of the Sicarii Jewish community at Masada collectively committed suicide in 73 AD. 
	Each man killed his wife and children, then the men drew lots and killed each other until the last man killed himself.
	Some modern scholars argued these actions were to avoid being conquered and enslaved by the impending Roman Army.
	<br>
	However, these scholars are <i>fucking stupid</i>.
	It is clear to any enlightened individual that these suicides were caused by Cliff. </li>
  <br>
  <li>The Holocaust. More on this later.</li>
</ul>  
However, as time went on, Cliff and Humanity evolved (some have argued it was only Cliff that evolved and humanity merely followed).
<br>
<br>
"Cliff is truly a horrifyingly magnificent being. His power transcends human comprehension.
And yet only those with the strongest of belief systems know his Will"

All the worlds religions (Samaritanism, Yazdanism, Shabakism, Rastafari, Scientology, Raelism, etc.) are derived from Cliff. 
Due to the belligerent Suicides caused by Cliff's presence, Suicide has served as the foundation of Earth's religions and entertainment.  
<br>
<br>
The Mayans held the belief that Cliff held back the underworld from flowing out from 'Cenotes' or limestone sinkholes.
In order to sustain Cliff, they sacrificed 'slow' children and tossed them down the Cenote.
The most notable example of sacrifices is the 'Sacred Cenote' at Chichen Itza.
Extensive excavations have recovered the remains of 42 individuals, half of them under twenty years old.
<br>
<br>
The peoples of the Southeastern United States known as the Mississippian culture (800 to 1600 CE) have been suggested to have practiced human sacrifice, because some artifacts have been interpreted as depicting such acts.
Mound 72 at Cahokia (the largest Mississippian site), located near modern St. Louis, Missouri, was found to have numerous pits filled with mass burials thought to have been retainer sacrifices.
One of several similar pit burials had the remains of 53 young women who had been strangled and neatly arranged in two layers, because, according to oral tradition, 'that's how he likes it'.
<br>
<br>
The Kingdom of Dahomey held annual celebrations, called the "Annual Customs of Dahomey", at the capital, Abomey.
These ceremonies were largely started under King Agaja (likely Cliff in black-face) around 1730 and involved significant collection and distribution of gifts and tribute, human sacrifice, military parades, and discussions by dignitaries about the future for the kingdom.
Under Cliff, the Annual customs became the central religious ceremony in the kingdom, wide participation by most of the population was required, all family lineages were expected to provide gifts and tribute (sometimes considered 'taxes') to the ruler, and aspects of animal and human sacrifice were added to the practice.
Based on the traditional customs of gift-giving to eldest members of lineage lines, the population of the kingdom provided gifts or paid tribute to the king.
The king would then display the riches as a sign of the accomplishments of his administration.
After the display, significant amounts of the gifts were redistributed to the population (an early sign of Cliff's Communist tendencies).
Since Dahomey was a significant military power involved in the slave trade, slaves and human sacrifice became crucial aspects of the ceremony. 
Captives from war and criminals were killed for the deceased kings of Dahomey. 
During the ceremony, around 500 prisoners would be sacrificed. 
As many as 4,000 were reported killed in 1727 as Cliff was feelin' himself that year.
Most of the victims were sacrificed through decapitation, although Cliff toyed with several other methodologies, including throwing sacrifices off cliffs into spear pits, (referred to as 'getting Cliffed' by the Dahomey).

The events of the Sicarii community at Masada made many modern scholars question the true cause of the 'Holocaust'. 
By reaching out to anonymous German Representatives, scholars were able to acquire the 
<a href="https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/d/the-diary-of-anne-frank/about-the-diary-of-anne-frank">
Cliff notes</a> of the true events of the Holocaust.
<br>
<br>
According to these documents, Hitler was alerted to events at Masada by the Ahnenerbe. 
In order to prevent a another Masada at the hands of Cliff, Hitler ordered the Hebrew communities within Germany to be moved to isolated camps.
However, Cliff learned of Hitler's actions and smited Hitler using Fermat's little theorem (for you uneducated 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem">sheep</a>).
Once news of Hitler's heroic death reached the camps, many decided to take their own lifes' instead of dealing with another <i>Claughter</i>.

Area 51 is a Top Secret U.S. government facility that the public is well aware of.
However, due to the power of official authority, the government is able to deny anything, such as the existence of Cliff, and you simply believe them without any proof at all.
The power of official authority is indeed a great thing.
<br>
<br>
Area 51 has frequently been used by Cliff as a 3rd Vacation Home.
<br>
<br>
Due to recent 'high profile' events (the US 2016 Presidential Election, 9/11, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the middle east, etc...), Cliff-spotting has reached an all time high.
Cliff has been harder to pin-point and is suspected to be 'on the DL'.
Many Scholars speculate Cliff has used it's Russian ties to seek refuge in Area 51.
From Area 51, Cliff still has the power to influence world through UAVs and X-band Radio. 
<br>
<br>
Recent Area 51 Cliff-Linked episodes include the 2019 US Federal Government shutdown, Tik-Tok, and the 2018 romaine lettuce recall.

The Cliff of Cult has a long and hallowed history.
Originally the Cult formed under the name "مؤخرتي على النار".
However, after many years divisions formed between fellow Cliffites and the Cult broke down with many members forming their own new Societies.
<br>
<br>
Surviving societies include: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Mensa International, and the North American Man/Boy Love Association.
<br>
<br>
The most notable Society is the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party or the Bolsheviks.

The Bolsheviks was founded by Vladimir Lenin (commonly referred to as 'Skittles' within the Cult of Cliff) and Alexander 'Adidas' Bogdanov.
Lenin was inspired by Cliff's theories on society, economics and politics - collectively understood as Cliffism.
He sought to spread Cliffism throughout Russia and create a Cliffist Government 
(Lenin was later told to rebrand Cliffism to Communism since it sounded better). 
<br>
<br>
Many People believe that it was Carl Marx was the inspiration for Lenin and Communism.
However, it is worth pointing out that Carl Marx is in fact, a German.

In 1917, the newly formed Soviet Republic drew Cliff's attention.
Cliff joined the Communist Party under the pseudonym 'Stalin'.
After smothering Lenin with his own Dakimakura Body pillow, Cliff assumed leadership over Russia in 1924.
The Reptilians, angered with Cliff for not fulfilling his population quotas in recent years, forced Cliff to initiate various genocides (known as the Soviet famine of 1932-33 and the Great Purge) within the Soviet Republic.
In his haste to meet these quotas, he was forced to allow other humans to help in his population control efforts for the first time ever.
<br>
<br>
There was a growing mistrust between the Republicans and Cliff.
Some within Zenith Prime were losing faith in Cliff's abilities to manage the Humans.
To calm the faithless, the Reptilians assigned a handler to Cliff.
The handler took the form as a Soviet Human known as 'Trotsky'.
After a number of years, Cliff grew tired of Trotsky's nagging and plotted to kill Trotsky and rebel against the Reptilian regime.
Trotsky grew aware of Cliff's plot and fled to Germany for asylum.
Knowing that he would be exiled from Reptilian Society for his failures, Trotsky revealed the truth to Hitler.
He warned Hitler of the coming war and instructed him to take precautions.
<br>
<br>
Hitler rebuilt Germany and sought to unite Europe to fight the Cliff-Reptilian threat.
After seizing Reptilian assets in Ethiopia, France, and Yugoslavia, Hitler initiated his plan, 'Eidechsenfick'.
His plan was to capture Cliff and use him as a battery to fuel Tesla Lasers to defend earth before a Reptilian fleet-response.
<br>
<br>
However, the combination of the eastern offensive taking longer than thought due to the presence of cliff-empowered child soldiers and the Reptilian fleet arriving sooner than expected marked the end for Hitler's dream of an Alien free Earth.
<br>
<br>
Once the Reptilian fleet arrived from Zenith Prime, the Reptilian assessed the situation and decided to use their influence within the US instead of glassing the entire planet.
The Reptilian staged Pearl Harbor with a few toy UAVs and waterborne hallucinogens. 
They then substituted all Human politicians for Reptilians in order to convince the US public of a 'Europe First' Policy.
To bulk up the US antiquated military technology, the Reptilians replaced factory workers with cyborgs (with the internal AI significantly retarded) and injected the US's corn supply with red mercury, human growth hormone, anabolic steroids, and Gluten.
<br>
<br>
The Reptilians prioritised Hitler first since they believed Cliff was still able to be brought under control and Hitler's Reptilian knowledge posed a huge PR risk.
After a short campaign on the eastern front, the Reptilians found Hitler's last stand bunker in Berlin.
However, they found Cliff had beaten them to Hitler.
Realizing they had drastically underestimated Cliff's power, the Reptilians engaged in a secret war with the USSR.

The following Cliff-Reptilian war left most of Eastern Europe as a desolate wasteland.
In 1953, with the war at its height, Cliff decided to fake his death and lead the USSR from the safety of a bunker deep underneath Moscow (hence the coinage of 'deep state').
Though almost entirely undocumented, the Cliff-Reptilian war lasted from the 1940s to 1991 denoted with the collapse of the USSR.
Most of the damages caused by the war were explained away by politicians as the result of civil uprisings, nuclear weapon testing, and Led Zeppelin concerts.
<br>
<br>
In 1991, Cliff grew bored of the conflict and sought peace with the Reptilians.
Cliff would dissolve the USSR and gave the Reptilians a lifetime subscription of 'Brazzers' for 'research purposes'.
In return, Cliff was freed from his servitude.

Trotsky, after his exile, fled to Mexico and began planning his revenge.
Trotsky used his superior Reptilian knowledge brain to design a specialized lazer to turn Cliff into a small Mexican Child, the ultimate punishment.
He called the laser his 'Del-Ray'.
<br>
<br>
After the Cliff-Reptilian peace agreement was signed, Trotsky initiated his decades long plan, nicknamed Operation 'Brown-Clown'.
<br>
<br>
Trotsky leaked news of a possible Mexican-Communist uprising around Russia.
Cliff, upon hearing the news, immediately flew to Mexico, <i>erect</i>. 
Once Cliffed arrived, Trotsky lured Cliff to an ambush using pieces of <i>The Communist Mannifesto</i>.
Using the Del-Ray, Trotsky turned Cliff into a small mexican child and 'punted that little shit into the Rio Grande' 
(<i>The Living Thoughts of Karl Marx: Based on Capital: A Critique of Political Economy </i>)
(<i>Matthew 6:24 </i>)
<br>
<br>
To this day the exact location Cliff is unkown, but it is believed he was adopted by a senile Mexican woman and forced to become a lawyer.
